# The approach of TADac to study activity of TADs and their association with cancer malignancy and drug response 

Chromatin domains play a significant role in cancer development and are increasingly recognized as potential targets for cancer therapy. Chromatin, which consists of DNA and associated proteins, undergoes various modifications and structural changes that regulate gene expression. Alterations in chromatin structure and function contribute to the dysregulation of gene expression observed in cancer cells. Chromatin domains, often called as topologically associated domains (TAD) regions that are segregated. 
The reason and effect colocalization of genes in the TADs have been rarely comprehensively studied in context of cancer. 
Chromatin domains can be disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations, inversions, and deletions. These changes can affect the change in expression of genes. However most of the studies have shown that mutation at TAD boundary does necessarily change expression of genes. Hence a better approach is needed to study TAD activity changes. Therefore we devised our approach called as TADac. 
(check out our [**preprint**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.15.524115v1) for details).

We analysed chromatin interaction profiles of head and neck cancer (HNSC) cell lines and integrated it with single-cell profiles of their drug resistant versions. This lead to further expansion of study analyzing the transcriptome of 819 cell lines (from CCLE database) and their response for 544 drugs(CTRPV2 portal). Further, it helped us in making useful iferences from transcriptome profile of 9014 patients across 20 cancer types made available by the TCGA consortium.
